What we have
------------

## $rootScope.trips

This is the big and growing array containing all trips. Fetched trip data is stored in the corresponding array field.

## $rootScope.trip

Array containing the currently selected trip id and it's field index in $rootScope.trips.

## $rootScope.brush

Array containing the domain of the current trip and the current extent of the brush.


What is happening here
----------------------

1. Get all trips from server and store it in $rootScope.trips

2. User selects a trip in the table.

3. The trip and it's array index are stored in $rootScope.trip.

4. Sensor data is fetched and stored inside the corresponding field of $rootScope.trips.

5. With every sensor data fetched, the domain of the trip is recalculated. (FIXME: Only do this if it's the first time we are fetching trip data.)
